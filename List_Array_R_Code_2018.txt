#Array:
#An array is a natural extension to a matrix in its number of dimensions. More specifically, 
#an array is a vector that is represented and accessible in a given number of dimensions (mostly more than two dimensions).
#To create an array, we call array() by supplying a vector of data, how this data is arranged in different dimensions, 
#and sometimes the names of the rows and columns of these dimensions.Suppose we have some data (10 integers from 0 to 9) 
#and we need to arrange them in three dimensions: 1 for the first dimension, 5 for the second, and 2 for the third:
a1 <- array(c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), dim = c(1, 5, 2))
a1
#we can add names for these dimensions when we create the array:
a1 <- array(c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), dim =c(1, 5, 2),
            dimnames =list(c("r1"), c("c1", "c2", "c3", "c4", "c5"), c("k1", "k2")))
a1

#we can call dimnames(x) <- to setup the names for each dimension by supplying a list of several character vectors:
a0 <- array(c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), dim = c(1, 5, 2))
dimnames(a0) <- list(c("r1"), c("c1", "c2", "c3", "c4", "c5"), c("k1", "k2"))
a0

#Subsetting an Array:

#The principle of subsetting an array is exactly the same as subsetting a matrix. Here, 
#we can supply a vector for each dimension to extract a subset of an array:

a1[1,,]
a1[, 2,]
a1[,,1]
a1[1, 2:4, 1:2]
a1[c("r1"), c("c1", "c3"), "k1"]

#Lists
#A list is a generic vector that is allowed to include different types of objects, even other lists.

#Creating a List:
#We can use list() to create a list, as the function name suggests. Different types of objects can be put into one list. 
#For example, the following code creates a list that contains a single-element numeric vector, 
#a two-entry logical vector, and a character vector of three values:

L <- list(1, c(TRUE, FALSE), c("a", "b", "c"))
L

#We can assign names to each list entry using named arguments:
Name_List <- list(x = 1, y = c(TRUE, FALSE), z = c("a", "b", "c"))
Name_List

#Extracting an element from a list:
#There are various ways to access the elements of a list. The most common way is to use a dollar-sign ($) 
#to extract the value of a list element by name:

#There are various ways to access the elements of a list. 
#The most common way is to use a dollar-sign ($) to extract the value of a list element by name:

R <- list(x = 1, y= c(TRUE, FALSE), z = c("A","B","C","D"))
R$z
R$y
R$x

#Alternatively, we can supply a number in double square brackets to extract 
#the value of the nth list member. For example, we can extract the value of 
#the second member of list R, as follows:

R[[2]]
R[["y"]]

#It can be more flexible to use double square brackets for value extraction from a list because, 
#sometimes, we might not know which member we need to extract before a computation:

member <- "z"
R[[member]]

#Subsetting a list:
#In many cases, we need to extract multiple elements from a list. 
#These multiple members also construct a list as a subset of the original list.
#To subset a list, we can use single-square-bracket notation, just like what we use for vectors and matrices. 
#We can extract some elements of a list and put them into a new list.

R["x"]

R[c("x","y")]

R[1]

R[c(1, 2)]

R[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]

#To summarize the above thing
#To summarize, we can say that  [[ means extracting one element from a vector or list, 
#and [ means subsetting a vector or list. Subsetting a vector will result in a vector. Likewise, 
#subsetting a list will result in a list.

#Named Lists:
#Irrespective of whether the list members have already got names when the list is created, 
#we can always name or rename the members of a list, by simply naming a vector:

names(R) <- c("A","B","C")
R

#To remove their names, we replace the names of R with NULL:
names(R) <- NULL
R

#Once the names of list members are removed, we can no longer access the 
#list members by name but by position and logical criterion.

#Setting Values:
#Setting the values in a list is as straightforward as working with vectors:

R <- list(x = 1, y = c(TRUE, FALSE), z = c("a", "b", "c"))
R$x <- 0
R

#If we assign a value to a nonexisting member, we will add a new member to the list with the given name or position:
R$m <- 4
R

#Also, we can set multiple values at the same time:
R[c("y", "z")] <- list(y = "new value for y", z = c(1, 2))
R
#If we need to remove some of the members in a list, just assign the NULL value to them:
R$x <- NULL
R
#We can remove more than one member from a list altogether:
R[c("z","m")]<- NULL
R


#Other Functions:
#Many functions in R are related to lists. For example, 
#if we are not sure whether an object is a list or not, we can call is.list() to find out:

R1 <- list(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c("x", "y", "z", "w"))
is.list(R1)
is.list(R1$a)

#Here in the above example,R1 is a list, and but R1$a is a numeric vector rather than a list.

#We can also convert a vector to a list using as.list():

R2 <- as.list(c(a = 1, b =2, c = 3))
R2

#It is also easy to coerce a list to a vector by calling unlist that basically converts all list 
#members and puts them to a vector of a compatible type:

R3 <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)

unlist(R3)


#If we unlist a list of numbers and texts in mixture, all members will be converted to the 
#closest type that each one can be converted to:

R4 <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = "hello")
unlist(R4)

#Here, R4$a and R4$b are numbers and can be converted to a character; however, 
#butR4$c is a character vector and cannot be converted to numeric values. Therefore, 
#their closest type that is compatible with all elements is a character vector.

#***************************************************************************************
  
#Data frames:
#A data frame represents a set of data with a number of rows and columns. It looks like a matrix but its 
#columns are not necessarily of the same type. This is consistent with the most commonly seen formats of 
#datasets: each row, or data record, is described by multiple columns of various types.

#Name       Gender  Age  Major
#Deepan      Male   32   Maths
#Abhishek    Male   25   Statistics
#Rupa       Female  26   Computer
#Raghu       Male   30   Computer Science

#Creating a data frameTo create a data frame, we can call data.frame() 
#and supply the data of each column by a vector of the corresponding type:

Data_Frame <- data.frame(Name = c("Deepan", "Abhishek","Rupa","Raghu"),Gender = c("Male", "Male","Female","Male"),
                         Age = c(32,25,26,30),Major = c("Maths","Statistics","Computer","Computer Science"))
Data_Frame


#Note that creating a data frame is exactly the same as creating a list. This is because, in essence, 
#a data frame is a list in which each element is a vector and represents a table column and has the same 
#number of elements.

#Other than creating a data frame from raw data, we can also create it from a list by calling 
#either (data.frame) directly or (as.data.frame):

R1 <- list(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c("a", "b", "c"))

data.frame(R1)

as.data.frame(R1)


#We can also create a data frame from a matrix with the same method:
R2 <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), nrow = 3, byrow = FALSE)

data.frame(R2)

as.data.frame(R2)

# You can see above that Note that the conversion also automatically assigns column names to the 
#new data frame. In fact, as you may verify, if the matrix already has column names or row names, 
#they will be preserved in the conversion.

#Naming Rows and Columns:
#Since a data frame is a list but also looks like a matrix, the ways we access these two types of objects both apply to a data frame:

df1 <- data.frame(id = 1:5, x = c(0, 2, 1, -1, -3), y = c(0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9))

df1

#We can rename the columns and rows just like we do with a matrix:

colnames(df1) <- c("id", "level", "score")
rownames(df1) <- letters[1:5]

df1


#Subsetting a data frame:
#Since a data frame is a matrix-like list of column vectors, we can use both sets of notations 
#to access the elements and subsets in a data frame.

#Subsetting a data frame as a list:
#If we would like to regard a data frame as a list of vectors, we can use list notations to 
#extract a value or perform subsetting.
#For example, we can use $ to extract the values of one column by name, or use ([[) to do so by position:

df1$id
or
df1[[1]]
df1[[2]]
df1[[3]]

#List subsetting perfectly applies to a data frame and also yields a new data frame. 
#The subsetting operator ([) allows us to use a numeric vector to extract columns by position, 
#a character vector to extract columns by name, or a logical vector to extract columns by TRUE and FALSE selection:

df1[1]
df1[1:2]
df1["level"]
df1[c("id", "score")]
df1[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]

#Subsetting a data frame as a matrix:
#we can use the [row, column] notation to subset a data frame by specifying the row selector 
#and column selector, which can be numeric vectors, character vectors, and/or logical vectors.

#For example, we can specify the column selector:
df1[, "level"]

df1[, c("id", "level")]

df1[, 1:2]

#Alternatively, we can specify the row selector:
df1[1:5,]

df1[c("c", "e"),]

#We can even specify both selectors at the same time:

df1[1:4, "id"]

df1[1:3, c("id", "score")]

#Note that the matrix notation automatically simplifies the output. That is, if only one column is selected, 
#the result won't be a data frame but the values of that column. To always keep the result as a data frame, 
#even if it only has a single column, we can use both notations together:

df1[1:4,]["id"]

#Here as above, the first group of brackets subsets the data frame as a matrix with the first four rows and all columns selected.
#The second group of brackets subsets the resultant data frame as a list with only the id column selected, which results
#in a data frame.

#Another way is to specify drop = FALSE to avoid simplifying the results:

df1[1:4, "id", drop = FALSE]

#In above code,If you expect the output of a data frame subsetting to always be a data frame, 
#you should always set (drop = FALSE); otherwise, some edge cases (like a user input selecting only one column) 
#may end up in unexpected behaviors if you assume that you will get a data frame but actually get a vector. 


#Filtering data:
#The following code filters the rows of df1 by criterionscore >= 0.5 and selects the id and level columns:

df1$score >= 0.5

df1[df1$score >= 0.5, c("id", "level")]


#The following code filters the rows of df1 by a criterion that the row name must be among a, d, or e, 
#and selects the id and score columns:

rownames(df1) %in% c("a", "d", "e")
df1[rownames(df1) %in% c("a", "d", "e"), c("id", "score")]

#Both of these two above examples basically use matrix notation to select rows by a logical vector and 
#select columns by a character vector.

#Setting values:
#Setting the values of a subset of a data frame allows both methods working with a list and a matrix.

#Setting values as a list:
#We can assign new values to a list member using ($) and (<-) together:

df1$score <- c(0.6, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8)

df1

#Alternatively, [ works too, and it also allows multiple changes in one expression in contrast to 
#[[, which only allows modifying one column at a time:

df1["score"] <- c(0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8) #example 1

df1

df1[["score"]] <- c(0.4, 0.5, 0.2, 0.8, 0.4) #example 2

df1

df1[c("level", "score")] <- list(level = c(1, 2, 1, 0, 0), score = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5)) # example 3

df1

#Setting values as a matrix:

#Using list notations to set values of a data frame has the same problem as subsetting–we can only access the columns. 
#If we need to set values with more flexibility, we can use matrix notations:

df1[1:3, "level"] <- c(-1, 0, 1) # example 1

df1

df1[1:2, c("level", "score")] <- list(level = c(0, 0), score = c(0.9, 1.0)) # example 2

df1


#Factors:
#One thing to notice is that the default behavior of a data frame tries to use memory more efficiently. 
#Sometimes, this behavior might silently lead to unexpected problems.For example, when we create a data 
#frame by supplying a character vector as a column, it will by default convert the character vector to a factor 
#that only stores the same value once so that repetitions will not cost much memory. In fact, a factor is essentially 
#an integer vector with a pre-specified set of possible values called levels to represent values of limited 
#possibilities.

#We can verify this by calling str() on the data frame (Data_Frame) we created in the beginning:
str(Data_Frame)

#As we can clearly find out that as per above code Name, Gender, and Major are not character vectors but factor objects.
#It is reasonable that Gender is represented by a factor because it may only be either Female or Male, so using two 
#integers to represent these two values is more efficient than using a character vector to store all the values 
#regardless of the repetition.

#However, it may induce problems for other columns not limited to taking several possible values. 
#For example, if we want to set a name in Data_Frame:

Data_Frame[1, "Name"] <- "John"

Data_Frame


# For abvoe code a warning message appears. This happens because in the initial Name dictionary, 
#there is no word called John, therefore we cannot set the name of the first person to be such a non-existing 
#value. The same thing happens when we set any Gender to be Unknown. The reason is exactly the same: when the 
#column is initially created from a character vector when we define a data frame, the column will by default be a 
#factor whose value must be taken from the dictionary created from the unique values in that character vector.

#This behavior is sometimes very annoying and does not really help much, especially as memory is cheap today. 
#The simplest way to avoid this behavior is to set (stringsAsFactors = FALSE) when we create a data frame using 
#data.frame():


Data_Frame <- data.frame(Name = c("Deepan", "Abhishek","Rupa","Raghu"),Gender = factor(c("Male", "Male","Female","Male")),
                         Age = c(32,25,26,30),Major = c("Maths","Statistics","Computer","Computer Science"),
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
Data_Frame

str(Data_Frame)


#Useful functions for data frames:

summary(Data_Frame)


#Another common demand is binding multiple data frames together by either row or column. 
#For this purpose, we can use rbind() and cbind() which, as their names suggest, perform row binding and 
#column binding respectively.If we want to append some rows to a data frame, in this case, add a new record 
#of a person, we can use rbind():

rbind(Data_Frame, data.frame(Name = "John", Gender = "Male", Age = 25, Major = "Statistics"))

#If we want to append some columns to a data frame, in this case, add two new columns to indicate 
#whether each person is registered and the number of projects in hand, we can use cbind():

cbind(Data_Frame, Registered = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), Projects = c(3, 2, 3,3))

#Note that rbind() and cbind() do not modify the original data but create a new data frame with 
#given rows or columns appended.


#Another useful function is expand.grid(). This generates a data frame that includes all combinations of 
#the values in the columns:

expand.grid(type = c("A", "B"), class = c("M", "L", "XL","XXL"))
